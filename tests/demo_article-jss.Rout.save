(Upper) Cholesky factor of class 'spam.chol.NgPeyton' of dimension 100x100 with 
917 (row-wise) nonzero elements.
    Density of the factor is 9.17%.
    Fill-in ratio is 2.07
    (Optimal argument for 'chol' is 'memory=list(nnzR=917)'.)
Class 'spam.chol.NgPeyton'
(Upper) Cholesky factor of class 'spam.chol.NgPeyton' of dimension 3082x3082
 with 146735 (row-wise) nonzero elements.
    Density of the factor is 1.54%.
    Fill-in ratio is 4.65
    (Optimal argument for 'chol' is 'memory=list(nnzR=146735)'.)
